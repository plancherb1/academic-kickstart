# Course Overiew Abstract.
abstract: It is often challenging to get nonlinear trajectory optimization to converge reliably without getting stuck in spurious local minima. Better methods for handling constraints in the optimization problem and improved design of objective (cost) functions can help alleviate this problem. Leveraging new methods of data-efficient machine learning and mathematical insights from optimization theory, we are working to design robust trajectory optimization methods that can be used for real-time nonlinear model predictive control.
