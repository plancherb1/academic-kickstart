# Course Overiew Abstract.
abstract: In order to improve the accessibility of STEM education we are undertaking research to understand and improve diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in STEM education globally and to design new interdisciplinary, project-based, open-access courses that lower the barrier to entry of cutting edge topics like robotics and embedded machine learning.
abstract2: As a part of this effort we help lead the Tiny Machine Learning Open Education Initiative ([TinyMLedu](https://tinymledu.org)).
