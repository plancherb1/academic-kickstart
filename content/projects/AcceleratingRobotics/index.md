# Course Overiew Abstract.
abstract: The next generation of robotics applications are facing a computational crisis. Facing thermal dissipation limits, CPUs have hit a single-threaded performance wall. At the same time the real-time computational demands for emerging robotics algorithms are only growing. To alleviate this bottleneck, we are developing software libraries that make it easy for other robotics researchers and practitioners to use alternative computing platforms (e.g., GPUs and FPGAs), as well as developing automated tools to enable the efficient design and use of custom robotics accelerator chips.
