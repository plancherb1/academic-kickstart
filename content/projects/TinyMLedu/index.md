# Course Overiew Abstract.
abstract: TinyML is a cutting-edge field that brings the transformative power of machine learning (ML) to the performance- and power-constrained domain of embedded systems. Successful deployment in this field requires intimate knowledge of applications, algorithms, hardware, and software. We are working to improve global access to TinyML educational materials through our [MOOC courses](https://tinyml.seas.harvard.edu/courses), the [TinyML4D Academic Network](https://tinyml.seas.harvard.edu/4D), and a variety of other projects.
