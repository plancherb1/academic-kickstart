# Course Overiew Abstract.
abstract: In this exciting Professional Certificate program offered by Harvard University and Google TensorFlow, you will learn about the emerging field of Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML), its real-world applications, and the future possibilities of this transformative technology. TinyML is a cutting-edge field that brings the transformative power of machine learning (ML) to the performance-constrained and power-constrained domain of embedded systems. Successful deployment in this field requires intimate knowledge of applications, algorithms, hardware, and software.

abstract2: The program will emphasize hands-on experience with training and deploying machine learning onto tiny embedded devices. This series of courses features projects based on a TinyML Program Kit that includes an Arduino board with onboard sensors and an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. To ensure you hit the road running, the kit also comes equipped with a camera. The TinyML Program Kit has everything you need to unlock your imagination and build applications around image recognition, audio processing, and gesture detection. Before you know it, you’ll be implementing an entire tiny machine learning application.

abstract3: This first-of-its-kind program combines computer science with engineering to feature real-world application case studies that examine the challenges facing TinyML deployments. This program is a collaboration between expert faculty at Harvard’s John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and innovative members of Google’s TensorFlow team.

# Roles in the course
roles:
- Co-designed a free, hands-on, project-based professional certificate taught through three 6-week courses on the EdX platform covering the emerging field of Tiny Machine Learning (deploying machine learning onto microcontrollers for machine learning at the extreme edge) with the aim of democratizing access to this developing field
- Over 35,000 students from over 160 countries enrolled as of March 2021 since the three courses launched in September 2020, December 2020, and February 2021 respectively
- Served as the laboratory instructor both co-designing hands-on exercises as well as recording walkthroughs to aid in student learning and success
- Managed the 10-person course staff to ensure that content was created, reviewed, and produced in a timely manner
- Led and managed external relations for the course team coordinating with edX, Google, and Arduino
- Co-designed course materials including short video lectures, readings, code walkthroughs, assessments, and discussion forums
