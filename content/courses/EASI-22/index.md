# Course Overiew Abstract.
abstract: Are you curious about how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to improve your everyday life? Do you ever wonder how your cell phone understands and responds to a question that you ask it? Have you heard the term Artificial Intelligence (AI), or Machine Learning (ML), but arenâ€™t sure about possible uses of ML or AI, or how you might prepare for a career in this field?

abstract2: This 3-day, hands-on/virtual workshop for high school teachers and students will give you experience in developing a real-world, applied application of artificial intelligence (AI) at the edge through hands-on examples of Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML). TinyML is a cutting-edge field that brings the transformative power of machine learning (ML) to small low-power computing devices. This course will expose participants to the applications, algorithms, hardware, and software of TinyML. No prior experience is expected!

abstract3: This program is a collaboration between Navajo Technical University, the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and Barnard College, Columbia University, and will be run virtually from June 22 to June 24, 2022.
