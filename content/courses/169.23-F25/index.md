# Course Overiew Abstract.
abstract: "Many stages of state-of-the-art robotics pipelines rely on the solutions of underlying optimization algorithms. Unfortunately, many of these approaches rely on simplifications and conservative approximations in order to reduce their computational complexity and support online operation. At the same time, parallelism has been used to significantly increase the throughput of computationally expensive algorithms across the field of computer science. And, with the widespread adoption of parallel computing platforms such as GPUs, it is natural to consider whether these architectures can benefit robotics researchers interested in solving computationally constrained problems online. This course will provide students with an introduction to both parallel programming on GPUs as well as numerical optimization. It will then dive into the intersection of those fields through case studies of recent state-of-the-art research and culminate in a team-based final project."

# grading breakdown
# grading: 
# - 40% Midterm Exams (20% each)
# - 35% Problem Sets
# - 20% Final Project Presentation, Report, and other Milestones
# - 5% Attendance, Collaboration, and Participation

prerequisites:
- Multivariable Calculus (Math 8)
- C(++) Programming (COSC 50). 
- It would also be helpful to have prior experience with Linear Algebra/Optimization (Math 22 / COSC 70).
- Contact the instructor if you have equivalent prior experience but do not have prerequisites ([e.g., pointers, arrays, and memory management](https://bit.ly/3159-S23-CppReview))

enrollmentNote: "Enrollment Capped at 45 Students"

# waitingList: "This class is capped at 45 students. This semester, I am handling the waitlist as an instructor-controlled waiting list. Students will be admitted based on a combination of seniority, interests in the class, and contributions to a diverse set of viewpoints and experiences in the class. To be considered for the class, please join the waiting list **AND** fill out the form at [https://bit.ly/3159-F24-WL](https://bit.ly/3159-F24-WL), which asks a few questions about your background and your interests in the class."

officeHours: "The most up-to-date schedule of office hours can be found [here](/office_hours). I will also try to respond to requests emailed to [plancher+courses@dartmouth.edu](mailto:plancher+courses@dartmouth.edu) within 2 business days. Faster response time will be achieved via the course Slack."
