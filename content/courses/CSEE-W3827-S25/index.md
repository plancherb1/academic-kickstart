# Course Overiew Abstract.
abstract: "This course explores the foundational principles of digital computing, bridging the gap between software and the physical hardware that executes it. Starting with binary representation and Boolean logic gates, students will progress through core topics in digital logic design and optimization, building towards the design of a processor and the assembly language with which it is programmed. By the end of the course, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of how software is translated into hardware operations, preparing them for future studies or careers in computer architecture, digital systems, and high performance computing."

prerequisites:
- You should be familiar with the basics of imperative, sequential programming. This is typically provided by an introductory programming course such as COMS 1004 or another similar course.
- Please contact the instructor if you have relevant prior experience but do not have prerequisites

# enrollmentNote: "Enrollment Capped at 85 Students (Instructor Managed Waiting List See Note Below)"
# otherNote: "COMS BC3159 can count as an AFC course for Barnard students!"

# waitingList: "This class is capped at 85 students. This semester, I am handling the waitlist as an instructor-controlled waiting list. Students will be admitted based on a combination of seniority, interests in the class, and contributions to a diverse set of viewpoints and experiences in the class. Half of the available slots will be reserved for Barnard students (assuming sufficient demand). To be considered for the class, please join the waiting list **AND** fill out the form at [https://bit.ly/3159-F24-WL](https://bit.ly/3159-F24-WL), which asks a few questions about your background and your interests in the class."

officeHours: "The most up-to-date schedule of office hours can be found [here](/office_hours). I will also try to respond to requests emailed to [bplancher+courses@barnard.edu](mailto:bplancher+courses@barnard.edu) within 48 hours. Faster response time will be achieved via the course Slack."
