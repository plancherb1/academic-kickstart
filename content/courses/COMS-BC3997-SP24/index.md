# Course Overiew Abstract.
abstract: "This course is designed as a **companion to mentored research and industry projects** in computer science that enable students to apply their learning in real-world contexts. While the course staff can provide general support for projects, they may not have the technical expertise to support all projects in depth. **Therefore, for Spring 2024, students are expected to have arranged for a _mentored project_ during the course registration period and will need to present their project topic _in the first class_.** For example, a student could be working on a research project mentored by a professor or helping a local company develop a web interface to their product mentored by a company software engineer. **Mentors must commit to meeting with students at least every other week.** The course will be run through a mix of lecture and group work led by the course instructor as well as guest instructors from both industry and academia. Lectures cover a variety of applied computing topics designed to complement student projects and engage students with often underexplored considerations for effective and sustainable real-world projects. Students are evaluated both by their mentor on their project progress as well as by the course staff and peers on written deliverables and presentations.

  *Note: Per University policies, you cannot both receive payment and course credit, or credit in two courses, for a single project. However, expanded projects may be acceptable. Similarly, projects done in groups will need to have larger scope. If your project falls into any of these categories, please reach out to the course staff.*"
