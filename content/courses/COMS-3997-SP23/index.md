# Course Overiew Abstract.
abstract: "This course is designed as a companion for independent projects taken on by undergraduate students. **Students are expected to bring a project to the course. These projects will ideally already have a technical mentor who can support the student through the project.** For example, a student could be working on a research project with a professor or a part-time internship with a local company (note: you cannot both receive payment and course credit for the same project). Students may be admitted into the course without a technical mentor if they can demonstrate that they have the requisite background in the topic and resources to reach out to for support. **This course, and its weekly meetings, are designed to provide additional support and guidance on top of that existing technical support. Each week we will also survey a topic that will be crucial for students' future careers in both academia and industry.** This will be done through a mix of lecture and group work led by both the course instructor as well as guest instructors from industry and academia. Students will also be given opportunities to check in and seek help from the rest of the class on their projects. To document their projects and begin to build their personal portfolio, students will (learn how to and) develop a website, report, and presentation about both the final result of their project as well as the journey taken to get to their final result."

enrollmentNote: Enrollment Capped at 24 Students (Instructor Managed Waiting List See Note Below)

waitingList: This class is capped at 24 students. This semester, I am handling the waitlist as an instructor-controlled waiting list. Students will be admitted based on a combination of seniority, interests in the class, and contributions to a diverse set of viewpoints and experiences in the class. Half of the available slots will be reserved for Barnard students (assuming sufficient demand). To be considered for the class, please join the waiting list **AND** fill out the form at [https://bit.ly/COMS3997-SP23-WL](https://bit.ly/COMS3997-SP23-WL), which asks a few questions about your background and your interests in the class.

officeHours: My open office hours will be typically held on Tuesdays from 11am-1pm for the Spring 2023 semester, but/and I am always available to meet outside of the standard time frame (ideally still on Tuesdays) by appointment.

The most up-to-date schedule of office hours can be found [here](/office_hours).
