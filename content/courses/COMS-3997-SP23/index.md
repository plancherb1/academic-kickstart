# Course Overiew Abstract.
abstract: "This course is designed as a companion to independent research and industry projects taken on by undergraduate students. The course staff is working to source a limited amount of projects, however, students are welcome and encouraged to bring a project to the course. Projects must be supervised by a  mentor who is committed to meeting with the student at least once a week to provide advice and guidance on the technical focus of the project. This course, and its weekly meetings, are designed to provide additional support and guidance on additional topics that will be crucial for students' future careers in both academia and industry. Each week we will cover a high level topic through a mix of lecture and group work led by both the lead course instructor as well as guest instructors from industry and academia. Students will also be given opportunities to check in and seek help from the rest of the class on their individual projects. To document their projects and begin to build their personal portfolio, students will (learn how to and) develop a website, report, and presentation about both the final result of their project as well as the journey taken to get to their final result."

enrollmentNote: Enrollment Capped at 25 Students (Instructor Managed Waiting List See Note Below)

waitingList: This class is capped at 25 students. This semester, I am handling the waitlist as an instructor-controlled waiting list. Students will be admitted based on a combination of seniority, interests in the class, and contributions to a diverse set of viewpoints and experiences in the class. Half of the available slots will be reserved for Barnard students (assuming sufficient demand). To be considered for the class, please join the waiting list **AND** fill out the form at [https://bit.ly/COMS3997-SP23-WL](https://bit.ly/COMS3997-SP23-WL), which asks a few questions about your background and your interests in the class. Initial placements into the class will be made by the end of May based on signups and submissions received during early registration in April.

officeHours: My open office hours will be typically held on Tuesdays from 11am-1pm for the Spring 2023 semester, but/and I am always available to meet outside of the standard time frame (ideally still on Tuesdays) by appointment. I will try to respond to requests emailed to [bplancher+coms3997@barnard.edu](mailto:bplancher+coms3997@barnard.edu) within 24 hours during the weekdays and within 48 hours over the weekend. The most up-to-date schedule of office hours can be found [here](/office_hours).
