abstract: Given the proliferation of affordable microprocessors and accompanying microcontrollers which sit at the heart of the electronic devices that surround us, a modern engineering curriculum must teach the concepts that comprise the field of embedded systems. This work presents a model for a modular course, seated outside the traditional classroom, from which students and faculty can pick-and-choose the material that is relevant to their interests, doing so in a flexible way that is not obstructed by a list of prerequisite units. Guidance for maintaining accessibility, generality, and module independence accompanies a provided content map. This work culminates in a demonstration of a proof-of-concept aligned to the recommendations made along the way.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract. Can also be used as a summary for an extended abstract or poster etc.
