abstract: "Artificial intelligence (AI) will likely be an instrumental part of progress towards the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, its adoption and impact are limited by the immense power consumption, strong connectivity requirements and high costs of cloud-based deployments. TinyML is a new technology that allows machine learning (ML) models to run on low-cost, low-power microcontrollers, circumventing many of these issues. We believe that TinyML has a significant role to play in achieving the SDGs and facilitating scientific research in areas such as environmental monitoring, physics of complex systems and energy management. To broaden access and participation and increase the impact of this new technology, we present an initiative that is creating and supporting a global network of academic institutions working on TinyML in developing countries. We suggest the development of additional open educational resources, South–South academic collaboration and pilot projects of at-scale TinyML solutions aimed at addressing the SDGs."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract. Can also be used as a summary for an extended abstract or poster etc.
