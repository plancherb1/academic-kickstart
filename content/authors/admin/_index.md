# job_alert: I am on the academic job market this fall and looking for opportunities to research and teach at the intersection of robotics and adjacent fields. Here is my [CV](/files/Brian_Plancher_CV.pdf) as well as my [research](/files/Brian_Plancher_Research_Statement.pdf), [teaching](/files/Brian_Plancher_Teaching_Statement.pdf), and [diversity](/files/Brian_Plancher_Diversity_Statement.pdf) statements.

I am a PhD Candidate studying Robotics at Harvard University working with [Vijay Janapa Reddi](https://scholar.harvard.edu/vijay-janapa-reddi/home) and [Scott Kuindersma](https://scottk.seas.harvard.edu). My research is focused on developing and implementing **open-source algorithms for dynamic motion planning and control** of robots by exploiting both the mathematical structure of algorithms and the design of computational platforms. As such, my research is at the intersection of Robotics and Computer Architecture / Embedded Systems, Numerical Optimization, and Machine Learning. I also want to **improve the accessibility of STEM education.** I enjoy teaching and designing new interdisciplinary, project-based, open-access courses that lower the barrier to entry of cutting edge topics like [TinyML](https://tinyml.seas.harvard.edu/). I enjoy spending my free time with my wife, daughter, and [puppy](https://www.instagram.com/alvinkplancher/), and [ski racing](https://nemsracing.org/) in the winters.
