I am a PhD Candidate studying Robotics at Harvard University working with [Vijay Janapa Reddi](https://scholar.harvard.edu/vijay-janapa-reddi/home) and [Scott Kuindersma](https://scottk.seas.harvard.edu). My research is focused on developing and implementing algorithms for **dynamic motion planning and control** of complex, high dimensional robots by exploiting both the mathematical structure of algorithms and the design of computational platforms. As such my research is at the intersection of Robotics and Numerical Optimization, Computer Architecture / Embedded Systems, and Machine Learning. I want to **improve the accessibility of STEM education.** As such, I enjoy teaching and designing new interdisciplinary, project-based courses that lower the barrier to entry of cutting edge topics like [TinyML](https://tinymlx.org/). I enjoy spending my free time with my wife, daughter, and [puppy](https://www.instagram.com/alvinkplancher/), and [ski racing](http://nemasters.org/) in the winters.
