job_alert: #"My lab is **hiring for a postdoctoral researcher** with an ASAP start date to help lead our new NSF funded project: [Accessible GPU-Accelerated Edge Optimal Control Library and Benchmarks](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2411369&HistoricalAwards=false). Please submit your formal application through [Barnard's Workday Portal](https://barnard.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/Faculty/job/New-York-City-NY/Post-Doctoral-Fellow_JR4187)!"
#I am on the academic job market this fall and looking for opportunities to research and teach at the intersection of robotics and adjacent fields. Here is my [CV](/files/Brian_Plancher_CV.pdf) as well as my [research](/files/Brian_Plancher_Research_Statement.pdf), [teaching](/files/Brian_Plancher_Teaching_Statement.pdf), and [diversity](/files/Brian_Plancher_Diversity_Statement.pdf) statements.

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [Barnard College, Columbia University](https://cs.barnard.edu/) where I lead the [Accessible and Accelerated Robotics Lab (AÂ²R Lab)](https://a2r-lab.org). I hold affiliate positions in the Department of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/people/affiliates/) and [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/content/brian-plancher) at the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, Columbia University. I am also a co-chair for the [Tiny Machine Learning Open Education Initiative (TinyMLedu)](https://tinymledu.org) and an associate co-chair for the [IEEE-RAS TC on Model Based Optimization for Robotics](https://tcoptrob.org).

My research is focused on **optimizing robotic systems at all scales** by developing, optimizing, implementing, and evaluating next-generation algorithms and edge computational systems, through algorithm-hardware-software co-design (e.g., [MPCGPU](/publication/mpcgpu), [GRiD](/publication/grid), [TinyMPC](/publication/tinympc)). As such, my research is at the intersection of Robotics and Computer Architecture, Embedded Systems, Numerical Optimization, and Machine Learning. 

I also want to **promote a responsible, sustainable, and accessible future for robotics and edge computing**, including the development of new interdisciplinary, project-based, open-access courses that lower the barriers to entry for cutting-edge topics like robotics, parallel programming, and embedded machine learning (e.g., [Global TinyML Education](/publication/scalingtinyml4d), [Parallel Optimization for Robotics](/publication/paroptrobcourse)).

I enjoy spending my free time with my family and skiing in the winters.
