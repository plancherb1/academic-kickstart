Office hours are open to students in my classes, to students interested in computer science, robotics, embedded machine learning, and STEM education, or really to any students who would like to find some time for one-on-one, or small-group conversations, discussions, and questions. If that's you, you are welcome to drop in at any time during the office hours; no appointment needed.

For Fall 2022, my office hours are typically **Tuesdays Time TBD**, with some changes and cancellations due to schedule conflicts or holidays. The full schedule is below, with exceptions shown in **bold**. Changes to office hours will usually be noted at least a week in advance, except for (rare) emergency cancellations.

I plan to hold these office hours in person in my office, location TBD. If you prefer to meet via Zoom, or would like to meet at a different time, please let me know, at [bplancher@barnard.edu](mailto:bplancher@barnard.edu). I will try to respond to requests within 24 hours during the weekdays and within 48 hours over the weekend. 
<!-- I also request that any unvaccinated students (even with proper exemptions) meet me via Zoom. -->
