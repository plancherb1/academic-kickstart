Office hours are open to students in my classes, to students interested in computer science, robotics, embedded machine learning, and STEM education, or really to any students who would like to find some time for one-on-one, or small-group conversations, discussions, and questions. If that's you, you are welcome to drop in at any time during the office hours; no appointment needed.

**If you want to do research with me, please follow the instructions on the [AÂ²R Lab Join](https://a2r-lab.org/join) page.**

**If you are trying to meet me because I am your faculty advisor please come to office hours (see below) or email me to set up a different time at [bplancher+advising@barnard.edu](mailto:bplancher+advising@barnard.edu)**

For Fall 2022, my office hours were originally 11:00am-1:00pm or 2:00pm-4:00pm on Tuesdays, with some changes and cancellations due to schedule conflicts or holidays, but have moved to be a bit more sporadic to better account for student needs. The full schedule is below, with changes shown in **bold**. Updates to office hours will usually be noted at least a week in advance, except for (rare) emergency cancellations.

I plan to hold these office hours in person in my office in Milstein 512 (unless noted below), but will also offer hybrid meetings via [Zoom](
https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/my/bplancher). If you want to meet via Zoom or would like to meet at a different time, please send me an email at [bplancher+meeting@barnard.edu](mailto:bplancher+meeting@barnard.edu). I will try to respond to emails within 24 hours during the weekdays and within 48 hours over the weekend.

**Note that due to personal reasons, for November, I request that students mask during OHs.**
