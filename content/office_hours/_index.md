Office hours are open to students in my classes, to students interested in computer science, robotics, embedded machine learning, and STEM education, or really to any students who would like to find some time for one-on-one, or small-group conversations, discussions, and questions. If that's you, you are welcome to drop in at any time during the office hours; no appointment needed.

A few quick notes:
1. If you want to do research with me, please follow the instructions on the [AÂ²R Lab Join](https://a2r-lab.org/join) page.
2. If you are asking for a letter of recommendation, please follow the instructions on the [FAQs](/faqs) page.
3. If you are trying to meet me because I am your faculty advisor please come to office hours (see below) or email me to set up a different time at [bplancher+advising@barnard.edu](mailto:bplancher+advising@barnard.edu).
4. I plan to hold these office hours in person in my office in Milstein 512 (unless noted below). If you want to meet via Zoom or would like to meet at a different time, please send me an email at [bplancher+meeting@barnard.edu](mailto:bplancher+meeting@barnard.edu). I will try to respond to emails within 2 business days.

My Spring 2024 office hours schedule is below, with recent changes shown in **bold**. Updates to office hours will usually be noted at least one business day in advance, except for (rare) emergency cancellations.
