Office hours are open to students in my classes, to students interested in computer science, robotics, embedded machine learning, and STEM education, or really to any students who would like to find some time for one-on-one, or small-group conversations, discussions, and questions. If that's you, you are welcome to drop in at any time during the office hours; no appointment needed. Office hours are usually held in ECSC 117 and occasionally on [Zoom](https://brianplancher.com/zoom) please see below for specific locations and times and please reach out if you have additional questions.

A few quick notes to help you make the best use of office hours:
1. If you want to do **research** with me, please follow the instructions on the **[AÂ²R Lab Join](https://a2r-lab.org/join) page**.
2. If you are asking for a **letter of recommendation**, please follow the instructions on the **[FAQs](/faqs) page**.
3. If you are trying to meet me because I am your **faculty advisor** please come to office hours (see below) or email me to set up a different time at [plancher+advising@dartmouth.edu](mailto:plancher+advising@dartmouth.edu).
4. I plan to hold these office hours in person in my office unless noted below. If you want to meet via Zoom or would like to meet at a different time, please send me an email at [plancher+meeting@dartmouth.edu](mailto:plancher+meeting@dartmouth.edu). I will try to respond to emails within 2 business days.

My Fall 2025 office hours schedule is below, with recent changes shown in **bold**. Updates to office hours will usually be noted at least one business day in advance, except for (rare) emergency cancellations.

<!--
For Fall 2022, my office hours were originally 11:00am-1:00pm or 2:00pm-4:00pm on Tuesdays, with some changes and cancellations due to schedule conflicts or holidays, but have moved to be a bit more sporadic to better account for student needs. The full schedule is below, with changes shown in **bold**. Updates to office hours will usually be noted at least a week in advance, except for (rare) emergency cancellations.

**Note that due to personal reasons, for November, I request that students mask during OHs.**
